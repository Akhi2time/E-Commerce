# E-Commerce
My Goal for this project was to build an e-commerce site using the starter coded that was already provided. We build this using back-end skills, such as express.js, sequilize (API) so in can grab the database from my SQL. I also learned some new skills how sequlize, mysql, express all intertwine and work together to help build my E-Commerce site. The routes and models can be a bit confusing but with practice I'm getting hang of it.
